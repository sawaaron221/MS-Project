<h1> Developing Convolutional Neural Network Models to Mitigate Computation Time for Computational Fluid Dynamics </h1>
<h2> Description </h2>
The project developed two deep convolutional neural networks to upscale low- fidelity CFD to high- fidelity CFD simulations. The study focused on two-dimensional flows with five different geometries under subsonic flow conditions. ANSYS Fluent was used to generate the coarse dataset and the fine dataset to use as the inputs and the ground truths, respectively. The models were built using convolutional neural networks with regression algorithms.
